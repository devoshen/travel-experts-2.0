## Tasks & Problems (in order of attempt):

#### Hamburger Menu
- re-structured the header that now includes the logo and navbar
- inserted hamburger menu icon from FontAwesome
- implmented element.classList and addEventListener.toggle 

Future Improvements:
- dropdown hamburger menu to have transparent background (does not interfere with HERO section)
- perhaps more style changes to the navbar when toggled

#### Gallery
- created array of objects(photo info) including photo attributes
- created gallery of pictures with alt-text and themed travel description linked to external websites (opens in new tab) using JS loops combined with document.querrySelector and innerHTML functions
- Took forever, but finally was able to display the pictures with a time delay.

Future Improvements:
- loop the array back to first item after finishing the last picture
- smoother transition between images



#### Form Validation
- did not attempt because I ran out of time
- this should be an easy research on built-in HTML5 form validation


Future Improvements:
