## Tasks & Problems (in order of attempt):

#### Hamburger Menu
- re-structured the header that now includes the logo and navbar
- inserted hamburger menu icon from FontAwesome
- implmented element.classList and addEventListener.toggle 
- dropdown hamburger menu not to interfere with HERO section

Future Improvements:
- perhaps more style changes to the navbar when toggled

#### Gallery
- created array of objects(photo info) including photo attributes
- created gallery of pictures with alt-text and themed travel description linked to external websites (opens in new tab) using JS loops combined with document.querrySelector and innerHTML functions
- finally was able to loop display all pictures with a time delay (thanks to a friend that helped with setTimeout in a recursive loop)

Future Improvements:
- smoother transition between images

#### Form Validation
- made all fields required (didn't implement red asterisk)
- ensured email fields had the "email" input type
- password field enforced a minimum length of 8 characters and hid typed characters. 
- added custom CSS style for "invalid" fields (red outline)

Future Improvements:
- add display notice that password length requires 8 - 14 characters
- only HTML5 form validation used, consider implementing JS validations


## Additional Notes:
- device tested: dektop, iphone (gallery overflows screen, need to adjust css img on narrow screen)
- browser tested: FireFox, Chrome
- pushed to GitHub
- gallery external URL opens a new tab but if clicked on another link the first tab with link instead of creating another new tab
- submitted within a week after the Jul 12th 8pm deadline
