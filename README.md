# Problems:

## footer white space
#### inspection appears to indicate footer has top/bottom margin of 18. Set footer, body, and main margins to 0 but white space still exists. Set display: block, inline, and inline-block but white space still exists.
#### Googled and found setting margin: 0; for <p> in footer worked. Then applied same concept to header h1.

## Sticky footer
#### Did not have enough content in Login and Register page for footer to reach bottom of page.
#### Googled and found sticky footer on CSS Tricks with a flexbox solution.

## Device tested on iphone with Chrome.
### Home button on navbar appears cut off a bit.
### Need to fix navbar on narrow screen.

### Not sure what is preventing the hotizontal window to continue to minimize.
### Originally assumed it was the navbar, but when changed the font size to 0.9rem it wasn't the reason.


# Notes

### Found some examples of "@media (min-width)" which can adjust CSS when certain screen size was currently used to further play with window responsiveness, but I run out of time to implement.
